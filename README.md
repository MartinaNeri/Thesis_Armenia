## Vegetation and Lepidoptera Analysis

# This project conducts a detailed analysis of vegetation and Lepidoptera species 
# using various diversity indices, beta diversity partitioning, and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). 
# The environmental and species data are extracted from an Excel file, 
# and multiple statistical analyses are performed to understand biodiversity patterns.

## Requirements

# R packages necessary for the analysis:
required_packages <- c(
  "readxl",    # For reading data from Excel files
  "vegan",     # For calculating diversity indices and beta diversity
  "ggplot2",   # For creating graphs and visualizations
  "stats",     # For performing statistical analyses
  "dplyr",     # For data manipulation
  "patchwork", # For combining plots
  "adespatial",# For calculating Renyi's diversity profile
  "betapart",  # For computing beta diversity and partitioning turnover/nestedness
  "mgcv",      # For building Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
  "tidyr",     # For transforming data into long format
  "ggdendro"   # For creating dendrograms with ggplot2
)

# Install missing packages
installed_packages <- rownames(installed.packages())
missing_packages <- setdiff(required_packages, installed_packages)
if(length(missing_packages)) install.packages(missing_packages)

# Load libraries
lapply(required_packages, library, character.only = TRUE)

## Analysis Workflow

# 1. Alpha Diversity Analysis
# - Calculation of Diversity Indices:
#   - Shannon Index
#   - Inverse Simpson Index
#   - Species Richness
#   - Total Abundance
#   - Margalef and Menhinick indices
#   - Absolute Effective Diversity (AED)
# - Visualization: Boxplots of calculated indices

# 2. Renyi's Diversity Profile
# - Computation of Renyi's diversity profile at different equitability scales
# - Enhanced graphical representation

# 3. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS)
# - Calculation of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric
# - NMDS application for visualizing vegetation community structure
# - Graphical representation with labeled sample points

# 4. Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA)
# - Bray-Curtis PERMANOVA to test the influence of altitude on vegetation composition
# - Jaccard PERMANOVA to assess significance in species composition differences

# 5. Beta Diversity Analysis (betapart package)
# - Calculation of beta diversity using Sorensen and Jaccard metrics
# - Partitioning beta diversity into turnover and nestedness components
# - Multi-site beta diversity estimation

# 6. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
# - Analysis of altitudeâ€™s influence on species richness and Shannon diversity
# - GAM visualization for interpreting biodiversity-environment relationships

# 7. Vegetation and Lepidoptera Analysis
# - Vegetation Gamma Diversity:
#   - Observed and estimated species richness (Chao1 estimator)
#   - GAM modeling of richness and Shannon index
#   - Renyi diversity profile across altitudinal groups
# - Lepidoptera Analysis:
#   - Calculation of Lepidoptera species richness
#   - Regression models for altitude and road distance influence
#   - NMDS visualization of Lepidoptera community structure
# - Vegetation-Lepidoptera Relationship:
#   - Correlation analysis between vegetation diversity and Lepidoptera richness
#   - GAM models assessing biodiversity interaction

## Input Files

# Data is loaded from an Excel file
file_path <- "Final_merged_file_Italian_and_Armenian_data.xlsx"

# Sheets in the Excel file:
sheets <- list(
  spec_veg = "Vegetation composition data",
  env_veg_partial = "Environmental data (altitude, road distance, etc.)",
  spec_lep = "Lepidoptera composition data",
  env_lep = "Environmental data for Lepidoptera analysis"
)

# Read data
veg_data <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = "spec_veg")
env_veg  <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = "env_veg_partial")
lep_data <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = "spec_lep")
env_lep  <- read_excel(file_path, sheet = "env_lep")

# This script provides a comprehensive framework for biodiversity analysis in Armenia,
# integrating ecological statistics, modeling, and visualization tools.
